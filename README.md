ðŸ“š Student Record Tracker
Description:
This Python project allows you to add new student records. To make use of the program, you'll need to create an Excel sheet with a table that contains student details.
How to Create Your Excel Sheet:
Open Microsoft Excel or any spreadsheet application (like Google Sheets).
Create a table with the following columns:
ID: A unique identifier for each student.
Name: Full name of the student.
Marks: Marks or grades for the student.

Save the file as students.xlsx or any preferred name.
Example Table:

ID	 Name	       Marks
1	 John Doe	      85
2	 Jane Smith	    90
3	 Emily Brown	  88
Once your file is ready, you can use the program to add new records to the Excel sheet.

Technologies Used:
Python (basic input/output, data handling)
Future Scope:
Add options to update, delete, and search for student records in the Excel sheet.
Save records to a database for long-term storage.
